# Call Log Creator
Sometimes you need to keep track of what you've discussed in a call. But it's difficult to write or type everything that you've covered, so how do you keep track of this?

If you know what information you may be discussing ahead of time, this Call Log Creator helps you easily create a log of the topics of conversation discussed during the call. Simply check off the boxes while you are on the phone to create a detailed call log.
