# Call Log Creator

This app assists you with keeping detailed notes while on the phone. It's faster and easier to click instead of type, particularly when you are discussing complex topics.

You can add your own sections and options as you wish. It saves your settings to your local browser's storage, so feel free to add/delete to fit your school's needs and your note-taking style.

To use this effectively, I would suggest including anything you frequently discuss over the phone. If you find yourself typing something over and over, simply add it as a new item.
